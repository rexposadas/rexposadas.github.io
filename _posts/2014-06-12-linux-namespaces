Linux Namespaces
================

This following post is an exercise in Linux namespaces.  What we will try to accomplish is what you see below [insert image]. 

![namespace](/images/namespaces.jpg)


These are the properties of this model:

1. The host machine can ping namespace 1 (ns1).  
2. Ns1 can ping namespace2 (ns2) and vice versa.
3. the host machine cannot ping ns2 and vice versa.
