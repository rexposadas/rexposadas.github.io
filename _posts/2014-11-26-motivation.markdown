From time-to-time I get into a situation where I have *interesting* projects to work on, but I 
do not feel like coding. I can't bring myself to start typing.  The reason why 
I became a programmer was because I wanted to create, and I have pleanty of opportunities to do so.  Why do I feel this way sometimes? 

And I can\'t blame the language.  I currently program in Go. I _love_ go. It comes closes to what I would like to _feel_ when I am coding. I can't blame the projects. Let's face it, senior developers nowadays can choose what projects they can work on.  I chose some interesting ones.  I can\'t blame anyone around me.  
My wife supports me in my coding habits, my kid gives me time to work while I\'m in my office. Nope, I can't put the figure on anything or anyone for my lack of motivation. 

But this feeling of laziness (I can't think of another term), has to come from somewhere. And "no", I'm not lazy.  I put in the hourse to master my craft.  

Well, fingers should be pointed at oneself first.  What is it?  

After a while, I figured it out.  While my projects are interesting, in the past few months I've been working on them alone. Yup, that's the motivation killer.  Coding is a social interaction. I *love* working in team settings. And I haven't been doing that. Code is more meaningful when built with a group of commerades. 

Maybe it's time for me to find an open source project to participate in? I've been meaning to do that for a while now.
