      <description>Starting with generated art (using Golang). What is it? It&amp;rsquo;s digital art created by code.
What I like about it You can produce a ton of work in a short amount of time. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a degree in art and never really been an artist, but generated art if easy for someone who can code to pick up. It&amp;rsquo;s basic coding with basic math involved.
Getting started If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, getting up and running is what I need first.</description>

      <description>The goal is to print a binary tree in such a way that each level of the tree is printed in a new line. Also, each level of the tree should be printed from left to right.
Why is this cool? Because it uses channels to print the different levels of the tree.
Reference Here is the entire code Let&amp;rsquo;s write some code Our tree definition:
type Node struct { Value int Left *Node Right *Node } A tree is made up of one or more nodes, hence the Node struct.</description>
