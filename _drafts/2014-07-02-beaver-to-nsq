Beaver to NSQ
=============

Configuring Beaver as a producer for nsq. 

For the examples below, `172.17.42.1` was used as the docker host IP.  Change the example to the docker host ip in your environment.

### Beaver configuration

Set the output of Beaver to be an HTTP POST to nsqd.

	  [beaver]                                                                                                                                                      
	  logstash_version: 1
	  transport: http
	  http_url: http://172.17.42.1:4151/put?topic=test
	   
	  [in.log]


Setting up nsqd to listent to that port is documented on a different readme in this directory. 

### Checking out setup.

Write to our log file

	echo "my log message" >> in.log

Beaver will read this list from the file and then POST that message to nsqd.  The message is sent as the body of the POST. 


### Checking our config

On one terminal check nsqlookupd for the topic "test".

	watch -n 0.5 "curl -s curl http://172.17.42.1:4161/topics"

On another terminal check nsqd for increments in messages with the topic "test"

	watch -n 0.5 "curl -s http://172.17.42.1:4151/stats"
