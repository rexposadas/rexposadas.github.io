Leave it (the logging) to Beaver
================================

This post shows you how to get started with [beaver](https://github.com/josegonzalez/beaver). 


Follow the installation instructions in the Github page. 

# The Setup 

Run the following in order to determine if you have beaver up. 

	beaver -h

That should give you the manual. 

What we are going to do is simple.  Have beaver listen to a file and then output to stdout. It's a simple simulation of beaver listening to a log file and processing it's updates. 

Create a file that will serve as your log file. This is what beaver will listen to.

	touch in.log

Create a config file to tell beaver what version of logentries we would like. 

	vim beaver.conf

In the conf file enter:

	[beaver]
	logstash_version: 1

In one terminal start beaver, setting the config file and the file we would like to listen to. The command below should start a
	
	beaver -c beaver.conf -f in.log

In another terminal add content to in.log
	
	echo "hello" >> in.log

You should see something like this in the terminal you ran beaver in. 

	{
    "tags": [],
    "@version": 1,
    "@timestamp": "2014-06-19T15:22:38.907Z",
    "host": "provisioner",
    "file": "/home/rex/workspace/in.log",
    "message": "hello",
    "type": "file"
	}

Done!  Beaver is not working for you.
