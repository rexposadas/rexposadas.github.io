# Golang for front-end website development? 

I have been debating whether or not to use golang for front-end development.  The issues I see are:

1. Would I need to recompile everytime I make a small chnage to the code? That seems like a lot of down time when all I"m doing is correcting a form post. 
2. I will have a very hard time finding someone to own it.  I don't want to own the front-end, I simply want to get it start it. 

I _could_ use PHP, but that feels like capitulating.  I was asked in Twitter "Are those the only two options?".  For me it is. They are my two strongest language. I predict the future owner of the site will be terrible and I will have to either bug fix or refactor, or both.  Go/PHP will give me the fastest turn-around in solving any issue that may arise.
