Starting with generated art (using Golang).  What is it? It's digital art created by code.

## What I like about it

You can produce a ton of work in a short amount of time. I don't have a degree in art and never really been an artist, but generated art if easy for someone who can code to pick up. It's basic coding with basic math involved.

# Getting started

If you're like me, getting up and running is what I need first. It speeds up my progress if I can iterated on things. Here are some way to get started.


## Quick start 1: Use

todo: link to my repo here and the repo of the library I use.

```bash
go install github.com/rexposadas/art

art circle 
```

That should generate a .png file where you ran the command. If you're in a mac you can open that file in a browser with `open generated-circle.png`

todo: put image here
