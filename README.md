How this is contructed

1. Use hugo to generate files into the public folder. 
2. The content of that folder is moved to the gh-branch
3. That branch is what's served in https://rexposadas.github.io/


My Workflow

1. Create the site from https://github.com/rexposadas/personalsite. That's right!  This site is built somewhere else using hugo. 
2. copy the contents from the repo above from /public to the root directory of the gh-pages branch 

The site should serve automatically.
