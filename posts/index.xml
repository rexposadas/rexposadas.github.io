      <description>What I learned my first week looking into cyber security:
What I learned as a web developer applies. It&amp;rsquo;s more fun to learn than regular web development. It broadens my skill set. TLDR It was an exciting week dipping my toes in cyber security. Links and info I came across during my discovery:
cat To read plain text files. wget To download files. file To look at the file type. exiftools Read and write meta data.</description>

      <title>A first look at generated art (golang)</title>
      <link>https://rexposadas.github.io/posts/art_first_look/</link>

      <description>I wanted to start something, something that I can work on without the pressure of doing it well. For all you software developers out there, you know what I mean. You want to go back to a time when you developed software because you were curious and not because a customer is asking for a bug fix.
Enter generated art. I am not an artist. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an artistic bone in my body.</description>

      <title>Generated Art</title>

      <description>Starting with generated art (using Golang). What is it? It&amp;rsquo;s digital art created by code.
What I like about it You can produce a ton of work in a short amount of time. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a degree in art and never really been an artist, but generated art if easy for someone who can code to pick up. It&amp;rsquo;s basic coding with basic math involved.
Getting started If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, getting up and running is what I need first.</description>

      <title>I got this! No, I don&#39;t</title>

      <description>I confess, I have failed. I was given an assignment with an unrealistic timeline, but I still believed that I could complete it with sufficient effort, focus, and late nights. However, I did not meet the deadline. Is it acceptable for a programmer, let alone a consultant, to acknowledge failure? Perhaps.
Lessons learned. I attribute my failure to my lack of communication and the bravado I displayed thinking that &amp;ldquo;I got this!</description>

      <description>Leave it (the logging) to Beaver This post shows you how to get started with beaver.
Follow the installation instructions in the Github page.
The Setup Run the following in order to determine if you have beaver up.
beaver -h That should give you the manual.
What we are going to do is simple. Have beaver listen to a file and then output to stdout. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple simulation of beaver listening to a log file and processing it&amp;rsquo;s updates.</description>

      <title>Working with Binary Trees</title>
      <link>https://rexposadas.github.io/posts/binarytree/</link>

      <description>The goal is to print a binary tree in such a way that each level of the tree is printed in a new line. Also, each level of the tree should be printed from left to right.
Why is this cool? Because it uses channels to print the different levels of the tree.
Reference Here is the entire code Let&amp;rsquo;s write some code Our tree definition:
type Node struct { Value int Left *Node Right *Node } A tree is made up of one or more nodes, hence the Node struct.</description>
